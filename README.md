# Civic-Tech-Projects
Welcome to Civic Tech Projects. Civic Tech Projects is an open source collection of active projects for the Make-a-Diff community. In order to help you make the most impact, we only feature projects that are being actively built.

##Our Goals
* Help people (both technical and non-technical) find civic tech projects and contribute to them.
* Provide an easy way for people to search projects by skills needed.
* Provide a platform for tech and civic leaders to share their projects and find collaborators.

##Propose a New Project for Make-A-Diff
Project proposals can be submitted through our [submission form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V9RmJ4BW8gwQo3hQsUo5rEcuRnRJWbdxDtPwMZOvixU/edit#gid=0). 

##Submit an Existing Civic Tech Project
If you have an existing project with a repo, include a `civic.json` file in the top level of your repo.

We use civic.json, which is the metadata standard created by BetaNYC and adapted by CFA. This ensures your project is easily found through Code for America's API, the [CfAPI](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi#installation). 

`civic.json` looks like this:
```javascript
{
"status": "Beta",
"thumbnailUrl": "http://www.skyspaceinternational.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/NYC_Skyline_Thumb.97220225.jpg",
"bornAt": "BetaNYC Hacknights",
"geography": "NYC",
"politicalEntity":"",
"type":"Web App",
"needs": [
{"need": "Web Designer"},
{"need": "Node Dev"},
{"need": "Angularjs Dev"}
],
"categories": [
{"category": "Community"},
{"category": "Education"}
]
}
```
